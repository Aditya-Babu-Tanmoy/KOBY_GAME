<h1><ins>Creating KOBY: A Simple C++ Game with Raylib</ins></h1>
<h2>v0.1</h2><br>
Recently, I developed a simple game called "Koby" using C++ and the Raylib library. This project helped me understand core game development concepts, including:  

âœ…- **STL (Standard Template Library) usage.**<br>
âœ…- **Modular programming with multiple header and source files.** <br>
âœ…- **Function implementation for clean and reusable code.**<br>
âœ…- **Game loop mechanics and real-time input handling.**<br>


âž¡With guidance from AI, YouTube tutorials, and other resources, I successfully built this game from scratch.  

ðŸ§¸<ins>The Inspiration Behind the Project  </ins><br>
My 10-year-old cousin, Kabbya, once asked me, *"Whatâ€™s the point of coding? Writing so many lines just to make one thing work seems boring!"*
I explained to him that while coding may seem tedious, the real magic lies in how a few lines of logic can automate tasks, solve problems, and even create fun experiencesâ€”like games! Intrigued, he challenged me to make one for him. I said, __**"Letâ€™s do it!"**__

This project was a great learning experience, reinforcing how structured programming leads to efficient and scalable solutions. More importantly, it was rewarding to see Kabbyaâ€™s excitement when he played the game!
